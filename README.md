# Spatio-Temporal Analysis of AMR in Europe

This repository contains the research project for a Master's thesis focused on analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Europe. The thesis examines the correlation between AMR and antibiotic usage, alongside socio-economic factors and health expenditures.

## Overview

The emergence and spread of AMR pose a significant public health challenge. This study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating data science, epidemiology, and public health, to analyze large datasets and predict future AMR trends.

## Repository Structure

- `/data`: Datasets used in the analysis.
- `/src`: Scripts and source code for conducting the analysis.
- `/docs`: Thesis documentation, including chapters and related text.
- `/results`: Generated outputs, including tables, figures, and saved models.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and visualization.

## Installation

To set up your environment to run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python 3.8+ is installed.
3. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
4. Navigate to the `/notebooks` directory to run Jupyter notebooks, or run Python scripts within the `/src` directory.

## Usage

The repository is structured to facilitate replication of the analysis:

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis are performed in Jupyter notebooks.
- Model training, evaluation, and prediction scripts are located in the `/src` directory.
